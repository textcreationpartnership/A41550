            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>NOW more than ever, there is cauſe to ſay, the laſt Days and Times foretold by the Apoſtles<note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> and<note n="‖" place="margin">1 John 2.18.</note> St. <hi>John,</hi> are come upon us: For not only Iniquity in Practiſe doth abound every where, and the Man, and Manner of Sin, is daily more and more diſcovered: But alſo Perverſeneſs in Judgment, in no leſs than <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> walks bare-faced with thoſe who are ſo far delivered up to <hi>Satan,</hi> as to deny the Lord of Glory: For abominable <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> which is a Sink of the <hi>Cerinthians, Ebionites, Sabellians, Samoſatenians, Photi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Arrians, Semi-Arrians, Anti-Trinitarians, Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> and of ſeveral other Hereticks, doth now proudly appear, and, in Effect, defie Chriſtian Religion, and attempts to overthrow the Foundation of the Goſpel, not in one but ſeveral parts thereof: It is for me a Matter of Wonderful Grief, to ſee the Boldneſs and Impudence of that Abominable Hereſie as it were Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly to come in, of one ſide; and the Silence and Sluggiſhneſs of thoſe that ſhould oppoſe it, on the other:<note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 9.1.</note> 
               <hi>O that my Head were Waters, and mine Eyes a Fountain of Tears, that I might Weep day and night for the</hi> Guilt which is thereby contracted upon the Nation.</p>
            <p>My Purpoſe is for the preſent, by the Grace of God, only to give in my Evidence in the Caſe, and that as briefly and plainly as I can, to condeſcend to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Capacity: But if by Providence I be further engaged
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41738:3"/>in the Matter, I ſhall grudge neither Time nor Pains upon ſo Juſt, ſo Neceſſary, and ſo Glorious an Account, as to bear Record for the Fundamental Truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laelius Socinus</hi> the Uncle, and <hi>Fauſtus Socinus</hi> his Nephew, both of <hi>Siena</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſoon after the Death of Deteſtable <hi>Servetus,</hi> did the firſt conceive, and the ſecond bring forth their Damnable Opinions, which amongſt the reſt are theſe: They deny the moſt Holy and Adorable <hi>Trinity,</hi> Chriſt's Divinity, his being Coeternal in Time, if we may uſe that word, with the Father, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſential in Nature, and Coequal in Power; they will not own he hath given the Father Satisfaction for our Sins, but only obtained for us, by our Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to ſatisfie for our ſelves: They ſay he died for our Good, but not in our Place; he died for himſelf, not for his Sins, but for the Mortality and Infirmity of our Nature which he had aſſumed; he became not our High Prieſt till after his Aſcenſion into Heaven: How Man, before his Fall, was Naturally Mortal, and had no Original Righteouſneſs; that in us there is no Original Sin, as it imports a Deformity of Nature: The Holy Ghoſt they admit not to be God, no more than Chriſt, whoſe Incarnation they affirm to be againſt Reaſon, and without Proofs of Scripture: With <hi>Pelagians</hi> they are againſt Providence and Matters of Grace. All theſe, and others, abominable Errors, which deſtroy the whole Foundation and Work of our Salvation, are to be found in the Books of <hi>Socinus, Crellius, Oſtorodius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>How far will Men go, when once they are fallen into and engaged in an evil way? When God hath left them in the Blindneſs and Darkneſs of their Underſtanding, and given them up to the Imaginations and Counſels of their evil Hearts, to the Temptations of <hi>Satan,</hi> and to their own Natural Corruption: We ſee it in the caſe of that Wicked <hi>Arrius,</hi> who within a ſhort time, from the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41738:3"/>Year 323 till 336, drew a great part of the World after him; and in the other, of that great Impoſtor <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who agreed with <hi>Arrius</hi> againſt the Deity of the Lord Jeſus, wherein he is followed by <hi>Socinians:</hi> That Man, thorough a Judgment of God,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.11.</note> 
               <hi>ſending a ſtrong Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that Men ſhould believe a Lye,</hi> by the means of a Fooliſh Book, of a Nonſenſical <hi>Alcoran,</hi> of pretended Trances and Raptures, when he was in his Fit of the Falling-ſickneſs, and of the Cheat of a Pidgeon picking (as it had been taught) ſome Grains out of his Ear, as if the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> under that ſhape, had then been Suggeſting his Religion and Doctrine to him; with ſome Allowance to the Pleaſures of the Fleſh in this World, and Promiſes of the like in the next; by theſe means, and the Trick of his Tomb at <hi>Mecca,</hi> hath drawn a great part of the World after him.</p>
            <p>In order to ſettle their Impious Principles, <hi>Socinians</hi> go about two things: Firſt, To overthrow the Ground of our Faith and Religion, with their attempting to undermine Holy Scriptures, which are the Foundation and Rule of it: To bring it about, They affirm the Old Teſtament to be needleſs for Chriſtians; as for the Books of the New, they allow not the Authors thereof to have been Inſpired by the Spirit of God, poſitively againſt what is ſaid 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. and therein they would have ſome places to contradict others; grant this and you take away the Infallibility and Truth of Scripture; and if it be yielded of one Text, why not of many more? If ſo, What will become of Chriſtian Religion grounded upon the Goſpel? For if we muſt believe St. <hi>Paul</hi> who<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 1.11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>Certifies,</hi> it <hi>is not after Man, for he neither received it of Man, neither was he taught it, but by Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing <hi>Socinians</hi> do to promote their Blaſphemies, is, To make Natural Reaſon the Principle of Religion, for they give all to Reaſon, as if it was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41738:4"/>Infallible and could not be impoſed upon, and nothing to the Authority and Conſent of the Church, nor of Scripture it ſelf, according to this Rule of theirs, That no Interpretation of Holy Scripture is to be admitted, except it doth agree with Natural Reaſon, and to the Evident Experience of outward Senſes: Inſtead of the Traditions which <hi>Papiſts</hi> bring in, they would have their own Reaſon, without the Influences of the Spirit of God, to be the genuine and proper Interpreter of God's Holy Word: So take away the Rule, and you bring in Diſorder and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>We know and own, how Faith doth not deſtroy Reaſon, rather it doth Refine and Purifie it; ſo God forbid we ſhould exclude Reaſon from Religion, for 'tis Subſervient to it; Reaſon indeed hath ſomething of Religion; for by the Light of Nature, in things of the World, and Courſe of Providence, one may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced how there is a <hi>Being</hi> of <hi>Beings,</hi> a firſt Cauſe of all, and a God whoſe Power and Wiſdom appeareth in the Works and Order of Nature, which as<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 19.</note> 
               <hi>David</hi> ſaith, and<note n="‖" place="margin">Rom. 10.18.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> after him takes notice of, <hi>day unto day uttereth Speech, and night unto night ſheweth Knowledge.</hi> But our Religion and Faith in Chriſt is not a Doctrine of Nature, or elſe Salvation thorough his Name had been known to every Man, but Experience convinces us of the contrary: And St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth poſitively and plainly declare upon the Matter, in the caſe of thoſe who wanted no Natural Reaſon, when by the Rules thereof they would meaſure true Religion,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1.21, 22</note> 
               <hi>Became vain in their Imagination, and their fooliſh Heart was darkened. Profeſſing themſelves to be Wiſe, they became Fools.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All and the beſt Natural Reaſon in the World, nay the greateſt Gifts of Nature, in Knowledge, Wiſdom, Parts whither innate or acquired by the Philoſopher, Orator, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> come very ſhort of Faith, which in us is the Soul of our Religion; for,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> 
               <hi>The Natural Man receiveth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41738:4"/>not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are Fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, for they are Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually diſcerned.</hi> So that with St. <hi>Paul</hi> we may upon this account ask,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.20.</note> 
               <hi>Where is the Wiſe? Where is the Scribe? Where is the Diſputer of this World?</hi> Where is the Rational Man? <hi>Hath not God made Fooliſh the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this World?</hi> The Reaſon that is meerly Natural he hath infatuated; and to ſhew that Reaſon alone cannot bring us to true Religion, that is, to the Goſpel, it is called a Myſtery,<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 3.4.</note> 
               <hi>the Myſtery of Chriſt,</hi> and<note n="‖" place="margin">1 Tim. 3.9.</note> 
               <hi>the Myſtery of the Faith,</hi> and a great one too;<note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>for without Controverſie great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs, God was manifeſted in the Fleſh,</hi> then Chriſt is God, for none but he was manifeſted in the Fleſh, <hi>juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the World, received up in Glory;</hi> all theſe are appliable to Chriſt, and to none but him, to God made Fleſh. The Knowledge of this is ſo far above Reaſon, that to make it known, 'twas neceſſary it ſhould be revealed:<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 3.3.</note> 
               <hi>How that by Revelation he,</hi> God, <hi>made known to me the Myſtery;</hi> yea, ſuch a Myſtery as Natural Reaſon could not attain unto, for 'tis<note n="*" place="margin">Col. 1.26.</note> 
               <hi>the Myſtery which hath been hid from Ages and from Generations:</hi> Surely during theſe Ages and Generations there were thoſe Men who wanted not good Natural Reaſon, <hi>but now is made manifeſt to his Saints,</hi> not to every Man, for,<note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 13.11.</note> 
               <hi>unto you it is given to know the Myſtery of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not given:</hi> Then it comes not by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon, but 'tis a Gift of God. Now the Goſpel and the Preaching of Jeſus Chriſt, is the Doctrine of Chriſtian Religion; and this,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 16.25.</note> 
               <hi>According to the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Myſtery which was kept ſecret ſince the World began.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we want another Apoſtle's Evidence, we have it in St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the caſe of the Prophets under the Old Teſtament, who<note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.10, 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>enquired, and ſearched diligently, of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41738:5"/>the Grace that ſhould come unto you,</hi> all which had been in vain, but they got it by Revelation, <hi>unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themſelves, but unto us, they did Miniſter the things which are now reported unto you, by them that have preached the Goſpel unto you;</hi> no need of Revelation where Natural Reaſon can attain unto; yet without Revelation the Prophets, which wanted no Natural Reaſon, could not. I go further and ſay, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who are clear ſighted, far above Men,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 2.11.</note> 
               <hi>greater in Power and Might,</hi> and have a greater depth of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, What of them? <hi>Which things,</hi> ſays the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the ſame place, that is, the Myſteries of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, <hi>the Angels deſire to look into,</hi> not to dive, but to look into, to ſee and adore that Incomprehenſible My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, they cannot look into, or elſe they would not deſire it, for none deſires to have that which he hath, Angelical Nature cannot fathom thoſe Depths, and do we think the ſhallow Brain of the moſt Rational Man can? Hereupon I think I may follow our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's way, of arguing in the caſe of the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; only he doth from the leſſer to the greater, and I from the greater to the leſſer;<note n="*" place="margin">Mark 13.32.</note> 
               <hi>Of that Day, and that Hour, knoweth no Man, no, not the Angels which are in Heaven.</hi> Thus the Myſtery of the Salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind knoweth no Angel, much leſs any Man, be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo Rational, only as much as God hath been pleaſed to reveal in the Goſpel; that Knowledge comes not by Reaſon, or any thing elſe of Nature, but by Grace. I think this ſufficiently ſheweth, how deficient Natural Reaſon is, to lead us to True Chriſtian Religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Revelation, which God effected by means of Angels, Prophets, Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, and this not with a bare outward Declaration, but an inward effectual Working and Revelation of his Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not exceed the narrow Bounds I preſcribed my ſelf: So then in Oppoſition to <hi>Socinians,</hi> as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41738:5"/>the Perfection and Infallibility of Holy Scripture, we alſo muſt own, there are in our Holy Religion, ſeveral things above Reaſon: Indeed Matters of <hi>Fact</hi> do fall under our Senſes, but thoſe of <hi>Faith</hi> go far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them; Material things, ſuch as our Senſes, hold no Proportion with Spiritual, ſuch is Faith, highly elevated alſo beyond Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Certainly this Generation of Men, come under the Curſe pronounced by St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 16.22.</note> 
               <hi>If any Man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be Anathema Maran-atha:</hi> 'Tis to Hate and not to Love him, as to go about to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from his Right, and as much as in them lies, to deprive him of his Due, and diſhonour him, as he told the Jews,<note n="*" place="margin">John 8.49. Verſe 12, 18, 24, 28, 29, 40, 42.</note> 
               <hi>I honour my Father, and ye diſhonour me.</hi> Wherein? It is ſet down in ſeveral places of the ſame Chapter, as namely, they would not believe him to be <hi>the Light of the World,</hi> nor <hi>the Witneſs which he and the Father did bare of him;</hi> and that <hi>he was he,</hi> that is, the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Chriſt, the Son of God, who had told them the Truth he had heard of God, whom he there calls often <hi>his Father,</hi> for <hi>I proceeded forth and came from God.</hi> Yet 'tis as true as ſtrange, that notwithſtanding ſo many clear Proofs of his Divinity in Scripture, <hi>Socinians</hi> deny him to be God, without which he had not been qualified to be Mediator between God and us (for a Mediator muſt have the Nature of both Parties) nor gotten the Victory over all the Enemies of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Though to avoid Prolixity, I muſt not inſiſt upon the Proofs of our Lord's Divinity, which is the Life of our Faith, Hope and Comfort, yet ſomething I muſt now ſay to it.</p>
            <p>If we had no other Witneſs but St. <hi>John,</hi> it were more than ſufficient to condemn the Blaſphemy: In the days of the Emperor <hi>Domitian,</hi> one <hi>Ebion</hi> a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> and his Sectators, denying Chriſt's Divinity, the Apoſtle did write his Goſpel to prove it, which in ſo many
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41738:6"/>places thereof is done as poſitively, fully and clearly, as Heart can deſire: Only ſome few I ſhall take notice of, to begin with the firſt Verſe of Chap. 1.<note n="*" place="margin">John 1.1, 14.</note> 
               <hi>In the Beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God;</hi> compared with V. 14. <hi>and the Word was made Fleſh.</hi> Afford us this Argument, the Word was God, the Word was made Fleſh, therefore God was made Fleſh: And as the name <hi>Word</hi> is proper to Chriſt who was made Fleſh, it followeth, that Chriſt is God.

               <hi>the Image of the inviſible God:</hi> God the Father is Inviſible, no Man hath ever ſeen him, but he hath made himſelf viſible in the Perſon of his Son, who is partaker of his Nature: To this purpoſe the Lord Jeſus is ſaid to be<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 11.3.</note> 
               <hi>the brightneſs of his Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon.</hi> This is no Flattery to him nor Favour, for it is his Right; herein he is no Uſurper nor Intruder, for if he was, God would not ſuffer it, being, as he is, ſo Jealous of his Honour and Glory; 'tis therefore upon a juſt Title, that<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 2.5, 6.</note>

            <p>The Lord Jeſus himſelf declares at ſeveral times, how he came from the Father, that is, from <hi>above,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">John 3.31.</note> from <hi>Heaven;</hi> how the Father had ſent him, which is to be underſtood, when he became Man, and was born of a Woman: Now he could not be ſent and come, before he had a Being; and as he was come from the Father, ſo he returned to the Father, as he declared it to his Diſciples: But I deſire a ſpecial notice to be taken of what is ſaid:<note n="*" place="margin">John 17.5.</note> 
               <hi>And now, O Father, glorifie thou me, with the Glory which I had with thee before the World was:</hi> Whence we infer, how the Lord Jeſus was before the World, that is, from Eternity, for time began only at the Creation; how not only he was, but alſo had Glory equal with the Father: This cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of his Humanity, becauſe he was Born in Time, and he was not Glorified till after his Reſurrection; nor he could not have a Glory, except he had a Being, which Being had no relation to his Humanity, but to his Divinity: And becauſe, thorough his Humiliation, that Glory had been eclipſed, he was to return, and again to appear in it, after the Work he came about was over.</p>
            <p>There would be no end if I would enlarge, and bring in ſo many places as the Old and New Teſtaments do afford, to prove this Point, the ſtrength of which the bitter Enemies of this Truth, being ſenſible of, it makes them do what they can to elude it, and undervalue the Authority of the Scripture, which muſt be the Judge in the Cauſe, reſerving the Interpretation thereof to their own Fancy or Reaſon, as they would call it. Wherefore to be ſhort, I ſhall, according to the uſual way in Schools of Divinity, reſolve the whole into an Argument, which is this, He to whom in God's Word are appropriated the Names, Attributes, Works and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41738:7"/>Divine Honour, he is true Eternal God; but to the Lord Jeſus all theſe are attributed in Scripture, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord Jeſus is true Eternal God: We muſt deſcend to Particulars.</p>

               <hi>in his time there were many Antichriſts,</hi> and<note n="‖" place="margin">Chap. 4.1.</note> 
               <hi>many Falſe Prophets were gone out into the World.</hi> Theſe Oppoſers of Chriſt were of two ſorts, ſome who denied <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> to be come into the World, or in the Fleſh, that is, That the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> which took up the whole Expectation of the Jews, was not come; for we know the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">John 4.25.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be but one and the ſame: Now thoſe that confeſſed not Jeſus Chriſt to be the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> were <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to come in the Fleſh, that is, To take upon him our Humane
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41738:11"/>Nature and become Man. All Propheſies and Types under the Law, in every Circumſtance, were fulfilled in the Perſon of the Lord Jeſus born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and whoſoever denied it was an Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort of Antichriſts in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time, were thoſe that, as the <hi>Ebionites</hi> did then, the <hi>Arrians</hi> ſince, and now <hi>Socinians</hi> do, own Chriſt to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and a Saviour, but would have him to be meerly a Man, and only a Creature; a Man they would not deny him to be, but diſowned him for a God. Now againſt theſe the Apoſtle doth ſpeak,<note n="*" place="margin">1 John 4.15.</note> 
               <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that Jeſus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God:</hi> So by the Rule of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, and the Stile of Scriptures, we do infer, that whoſoever ſhall not confeſs that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is in a true and a proper Sence the Son of God, God dwelleth not in him, nor he in God; both which, that is, the Validity of this Inference, and the Apoſtle's Poſition, that Jeſus is the Son of God, do appear in the following Chapter,<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 5.9, 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>He that believeth not that Chriſt is the Son of God, hath made him a Liar, becauſe he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son: For this is the Witneſs of God,</hi> (which is greater than the Witneſs of Men) <hi>which he hath teſtified of his Son.</hi> Wherein the Apoſtle relateth not only to the Time of our Saviour's Baptiſm, when the Voice came from Heaven ſaying,<note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 3.17.</note> 
               <hi>This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> but alſo to the Transfiguration, when the Voice came out of the Cloud with the ſame words with this Addition,<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 17.5.</note> 
               <hi>Hear ye him;</hi> which St. <hi>Peter</hi> takes ſpecial notice of, when he ſaith, <hi>For he,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt,<note n="‖" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>received from God the Father, Honour and Glory, when there came ſuch a Voice to him from the excellent Glory. And this Voice which came from Heaven, we heard when we were with him in the Holy Mount.</hi> Where the Apoſtle plainly declares, That as the Voice came from God the Father, ſo it
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41738:11"/>was ſpoken of and to God the Son, or elſe the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Father and Son had been improper and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous; God in the Voice calls him his Beloved Son; the Apoſtle ſaith the Voice came from God the Father: If there was not ſome ſpecial Energy and Signification in the word <hi>Father,</hi> the Apoſtle would only have ſaid, that Chriſt received from God Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Father and of the Son, who are Relatives, that ſhews the diſtinction of two different Perſons of the Godhead.</p>
            <p>This Voice was the Application to the Perſon of whom long before <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. wherein the Kingdom of Chriſt was Propheſied of,<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 2.7.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord hath ſaid unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> Yea, ſuch as <hi>David</hi> whoſe Son he was according to the Fleſh, in Spirit calls him Lord; which place our Saviour makes uſe of againſt the Phariſees, for after they had anſwered his Queſtion, Whoſe Son Chriſt was? He much to his purpoſe asketh them,<note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 22.42, 43, 44, 45.</note> 
               <hi>If</hi> David <hi>then call him Lord, How is he his Son?</hi> This could not be in the Capacity of his Son, for the Son is not Lord over the Father; wherefore it muſt be upon ſome other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; there was between them another Relation, it could be no Humane one within ſuch a diſtance of Time.</p>
            <p>Hence is appears, That if God doth ſo often, and in ſo ſingular a manner, call the Lord Jeſus his Only Begotten Son, in whom he is well pleaſed: If God, I ſay, ſpeaks Truth, the Lord Jeſus muſt be his Son; not in that way of Favour and Grace only, as <hi>Socinians</hi> would have it, and as all his Elect are, but in a ſtricter and eſſential Relation; to beget, is to communicate his Nature and Subſtance; and in this Sence he is the only Begotten Son, there is but one thus properly God's Son: We have a Text which ſpeaks plainly to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and gives a right Interpretation of the Phraſe,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41738:12"/>the meaning whereof the Jews underſtood very well; it is ſaid,<note n="*" place="margin">John 5.18.</note> 
               <hi>The Jews ſought the more to kill him, not only becauſe he had broken the Sabbath, but ſaid alſo that God was his Father, making himſelf equal with God.</hi> So then when Chriſt called God his Father, he meaned that he was equal with God; the Jews ſay ſo, the Evangeliſt doth not ſay they were miſtaken; and our Bleſied Saviour,<note n="*" place="margin">Ver. 19, 21.</note> the beſt Interpreter of the thing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth they had a right Notion of the Matter; for in the 19 and 21 Verſes, he affirmeth his Equality in Power with the Father, <hi>For what things ſoever he doth, theſe alſo doth the Son likewiſe. For as the Father raiſeth up the Dead, and quickneth them, ſo the Son quickneth whom he will.</hi> This Equality in Power argueth an Equality in Nature; for though God can do great and miraculous things by ſome Creatures, yet ſtill 'tis the working of his own Power; but God cannot beſtow an Infinite Power upon a Finite and bound Creature, which it is not capable of, becauſe it would imply a Contradiction: An Infinite Power in Chriſt, ſuch as the Father hath, doth in him import an Infinite Nature. But at this time I muſt not ſuffer my ſelf to be drawn too far into the Matter.</p>
            <p>Well, as we heard, St. <hi>John</hi> calls Antichriſt him that denies Chriſt to be the Son of God:<note n="*" place="margin">1 John 2.22.</note> 
               <hi>He is Antichriſt that denies the Father and the Son:</hi> Surely Father and Son muſt have the ſame Nature, deny one and you deny both; <hi>Who is a Liar, but he that denieth that Jeſus is the Chriſt?</hi> To what he calls Antichriſts and Liars, St. <hi>Paul</hi> giveth the Name of <hi>Blaſphemers,</hi> and begins with himſelf, as he was before his Converſion,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 1.12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>Putting me into the Miniſtry, who was before a Blaſphemer and a Perſecutor.</hi> Wherein was he ſuch? He ſpeaks ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it when he ſaith,<note n="‖" place="margin">Acts 26.9.</note> 
               <hi>I verily thought with my ſelf, that I ought to do many things contrary to the Name of Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth. What doth he mean by the Name
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41738:12"/>of Jeſus? His Perſon he could not reach, his Members he perſecuted as much as he could; nay, as he ſaith, he compelled them to do as he did: What's that? To Blaſpheme; <hi>he compelled them to Blaſpheme,</hi> his Name,<note place="margin">Acts 26.11.</note> his Religion, and ſay many things againſt his Perſon, and deny him to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Son of God, and the Profeſſion of his Goſpel, to defame and diſhonour him: And do not <hi>Socinians</hi> do part of this, and the worſt of it, with, as much as in them lies, depriving him of his Godhead, attacking him in the beſt and moſt ſenſible Part: Methinks theſe Men ſhould have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and taken warning by God's ſignal Judgments upon former Blaſphemers againſt the Perſon of Chriſt. <hi>Arrius</hi> their great Founder, whilſt he was eaſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Neceſſities of Nature, his Bowels came forth, and with them his Life: <hi>Artemon, Samoſatenus,</hi> and ſeveral more in former and later Ages, came to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Deaths: The end of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate is well known: Theſe ſhould make them Fear and Tremble.

               <hi>Blaſpheming and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting,</hi> as they did, to what concerning this Matter was ſpoken by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Grounds of their Error I ſhall not at this time go about to refute, that I reſerve for another occaſion if God permit: However two things I ſhall mention, which like two Rocks they commonly ſplit upon, and this being well underſtood, affordeth Anſwers to moſt of their Arguments. St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s words, by him ſpoken in another caſe, I here ſhall make uſe of,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 3.5.</note> 
               <hi>For this they are willingly Ignorant of;</hi> namely, the difference of Chriſt's State of Humiliation, and that of his Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The <hi>Jews</hi> who receive not the New Teſtament, may be ignorant of this, yet not willingly; but <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> who ſay and pretend they admit it, cannot be Ignorant but willingly: After this Rule we may reſolve
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41738:13"/>thoſe places in Scripture, the Sence whereof, thorough their Prejudice, they miſtake, wherein Chriſt is made Inferior to the Father, and the Father ſaid to be greater than he: 'Tis moſt true, that as he performed the Office of Mediator, as he was Man, as at that time when he was upon Earth, in that low and humble Condition, he then was Inferior to the Father, but it was not ſo before, for he, to obtain Salvation for us, voluntarily left that Glory which he had with the Father before the World began, and <hi>of himſelf,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 2.6, 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>took upon him the form of a Servant, and was made in the likeneſs of Man; and he humbled himſelf, and made himſelf of no Reputation:</hi> He had a Being before he was made Man, and that Being, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle faith in that place, was the <hi>Form</hi> and Nature <hi>of God,</hi> whereby, <hi>without Robbery</hi> or Uſurpation, <hi>he was equal with God.</hi> After the time of his Humiliation was over, he went up to the place whence he was come down, again to appear in his Natural Glory, which Glory here he had ſtill, but it was under a Cloud, which made it inviſible to Man: His Humane Nature was that Cloud which Scripture calls<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 10.20.</note> 
               <hi>the Vail of his Fleſh,</hi> which under the Law was typified by the Vail of the Temple; becauſe the Light of the Sun, when 'tis behind the Clouds, doth not appear bright and glorious in our Eyes, Muſt Men ſay he hath no Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs nor Glory? Still there is enough left to convince us, that in it is a Light, or elſe it would be quite Dark: So though the Lord Jeſus his Divine Glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was eclipſed for a time, yet ſeveral Beams of it appeared in his ſtate of Exinanition, as in his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, Transfiguration, and when<note n="*" place="margin">John 12.28, 29.</note>

            <p>Their other Stumbling-block and Rock of Offence, is the Incarnation of the Son of God, or his taking upon him our Humane Nature out of the Virgim <hi>Mary,</hi> thorough the Operation of the Holy Ghoſt, which by no means they will own, though Scripture ſaith, in that Famous Propheſie of the Coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi>

               <hi>How ſhall this be, ſeeing I know no Man?

O that Pre-exiſtence hath no Humane Foundation, and can be attributed to nothing, but to an Eternal Being; he owneth he was not the Chriſt, but he was ſent before him to cry in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, <hi>Make straight the way of the Lord,</hi> Jehovah,<label type="milestone">

               <hi>and I ſaw and bare Record that this is the Son of God:</hi> Wherefore upon occaſion our Saviour ſaith of <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, <hi>He bare record</hi> of me <hi>unto the Truth;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 5.33, 34.</note> though I need no ſuch thing, <hi>for I receive not Teſtimony from Man;</hi> however he bare Witneſs unto the Truth, that I am the Son of God: And indeed if to prove it there was but one or few ſuch Texts and Particulars in Scripture
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41738:15"/>about Chriſt, ſome might happen to think there is room for Cavils and Exceptions; but ſo many things, and in ſo many ſeveral places, being ſaid to that purpoſe, and all tending to confirm that Truth, how he is True God, and Only True Son of God, there is no reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ground left to doubt of it.<note n="‖" place="margin">1 John 5.20.</note> 
               <hi>We know,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John, that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an underſtanding that we may know him that is True, even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt: This is the True God, and Eternal Life.</hi> Nothing plainer than that Jeſus Chriſt is the True God, Relatives ought to be applied to the next.</p>
            <p>Scripture mentioneth four kinds of Generation, the firſt, by Father and Mother, that is, the Common: The ſecond, without Father or Mother, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Creation; ſo <hi>Adam</hi> was begotten, and on this account called Son of God: The third, of a Father without Mother, thus <hi>Eve</hi> was formed out of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Rib: But the fourth, and more Miraculous is, of a Mother without a Father; thus our Bleſſed Saviour was born of a Woman without the help of Man: But all theſe do relate only to a Temporal Generation, but that of Jeſus Chriſt Son of God in a ſtrict Sence, by the Father, is Eternal.</p>
            <p>Now the Office of Mediator, required a Perſon that ſhould be both God and Man, to perform thoſe things that were to be done in relation to both: As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, To Suffer and Die, was the part of Humane Nature, which the Divine is not capable of; but to overcome Death and our Spiritual Enemies, could not be effected but by a Divine Power: And it alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Majeſty of God, that the Mediator ſhould be God; which Majeſty is ſo great, that none but he that is intimate and equal with the Father, could interpoſe between God and Man: Angels themſelves could and dared not undertake it, for they ſtand in

               <hi>What the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the Fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſinful Fleſh, and for Sin, condemned Sin in the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41738:16"/>Fleſh,</hi> is a place worthy to take up our Serious Thoughts: This ſheweth firſt, the Law could not juſtifie us, by reaſon of Weakneſs thorough the Fleſh, or Humane Nature, which to remedy, 'twas neceſſary God ſhould ſend his own Son to relieve this Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Impoſſibility; for that wherein our Nature, thorough Frailty, was wanting, muſt be helped by Divine Nature. Secondly, This ſheweth, how this help came by means of God's own Son, whom God ſent into the World, and by a Sacrifice for Sin, effected that which was impoſſible for any Man whatſoever to do. Now, if they can, let them find ſtronger and more proper Expreſſions, to ſignifie Chriſt Jeſus to be the True, Proper, Natural Son of God, than theſe in Scripture, <hi>God's own Son, the only begotten Son, which is in the Boſom of the Father, in whom the Father is well pleaſed:</hi> Can this be ſaid of one that is a meer Man?

Now as when the Spirit of God doth in Scripture call him Man, we ought to believe him to be a Man indeed; ſo when he calls him God, we muſt believe him to be God indeed; for with St. <hi>Paul,</hi>

               <hi>We are ſure that the Judgment of God is according to Truth:</hi> And immediately after his Converſion, he began to preach the Goſpel with this Fundamental Truth thereof, namely, <hi>That he is the Son of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 9.20.</note> And whoſoever owns him not to be truly God, gives God the Lye, diſowns him to be our Saviour and our Mediator; for as the Mediator doth act the part of Man with God, ſo with Men he is to perform the part of God; he ſtands between two Extreams, and reaches them both with filling the ſpace, though never ſo diſtant between them, he immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth unto God, whom he pacifieth towards Men, and from him, upon the account of his own Merit, obtaineth for them all Gifts and Graces neceſſary to their Salvation: All this none but a God can do for us.</p>
            <p>But here I muſt ſtop, for inſenſibly I am driven far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than I intended; only few words I ſhall ſpeak, in relation to the moſt Holy and Bleſſed Trinity, which they deny. Divine Nature is moſt ſimply and ſingularly one; yet in that one Eſſence are Three Perſons diſtinguiſhed in Number, Order, Manner of Acting, and with Perſonal Names and Attributes: And though the words <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Perſons,</hi> be not in ſo many Letters ſet down in Scripture, no more than the word Sacrament, Symbole or Creed, Lord's-Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet as we agree that theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in and deduced out of the Word of God, ſo we may ſay of thoſe now in queſtion.

               <hi>The Grace of the</hi> Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>The Love of God,</hi> that is, the Father, <hi>and the Communion of the</hi> Holy Ghoſt: This I ſhall conclude, with that of another Apoſtle,<note n="*" place="margin">1 John 5.7.</note> 
               <hi>For there are Three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and theſe Three are One.</hi> I think from the word <hi>Three,</hi> that of <hi>Trinity</hi> may well be derived: Here is proved the Trinity of Perſons, and the Unity or Oneneſs of Eſſence or Nature: The Trinity of Perſons doth not multiply the Nature, without any Contradiction a Subject may in one reſpect be one, and manifold in another: This is clear out of ſeveral Inſtances in Nature, Man hath a Soul, this Soul hath three ſeveral diſtinct Faculties, the Mind, Will and Memory; the Mind is not the Will, nor the Will the Memory, theſe are three different Faculties, yet but one Soul. In the Sun are three things, the Body, the Light, and the Heat of the Sun, yet not many Suns, yet only one. A Father hath a Son, the Father and the Son are two different Perſons, yet they have the ſame Nature and both are Men. There are many more ſuch Inſtances which I now forbear to mention, to ſhew how in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41738:17"/>created Subſtances Trinity or Multiplicity doth not deſtroy Unity; ſo we may reaſonably infer, that in the Godhead the Trinity of Perſons is no Prejudice to the Unity of Eſſence or Nature. But for all this they will deny the Divinity of the Son and of the Holy Ghoſt; the firſt I proved, and I think 'tis fit I ſhould ſay ſomething to the laſt, but as ſhortly as I can.</p>
            <p>In order to it, I ſhall reſolve all into one Argument, as before I did about Jeſus Chriſt: The Syllogiſm is this, He is True and Eternal God, whom Scripture gives to, the Names, Attributes, Works and Worſhip of God; but all theſe, Scripture attributeth to the Holy Ghoſt, therefore the Holy Ghoſt is True Eternal God. To begin with the firſt, I ſay the <hi>Names</hi> of the True God are ſimply and abſolutely given to the Holy Ghoſt,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>Know ye not,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you:</hi> The latter part explaineth the firſt, the dwelling of God alone doth make and conſtitute the Temple of God; and thoſe very ſame whom he calleth the Temple of God, he calleth the Temple or Dwelling of the Holy Ghoſt. We have another, when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ananias,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 5.3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>Why hath Satan filled thy Heart to lie to the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and in the next Verſe, <hi>Thou haſt not lied to Men, but unto God:</hi> Whom he before called the Holy Ghoſt, he now called God; theſe laſt words tend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerate and aggravate the greatneſs of his Sin: The name of <hi>Jehovah</hi> is alſo attributed to the Holy Ghoſt, for the Lord ſaid,<note n="*" place="margin">Numb. 12.6.</note> 
               <hi>He will make himſelf known to and ſpeak by Prophets:</hi> Now if we compare this with what <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.21.</note> 
               <hi>Holy Men,</hi> or Prophets, <hi>of God, ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> we ſhall find, that <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who promiſed to ſpeak by Prophets, is the Holy Ghoſt which moved them to ſpeak.</p>

            <p>However with Submiſſion it will be well to begin at Home, and every one ſee whither all be ſafe and ſound within the Pales of their Juriſdiction; and if there appears any ſigns of Leproſie and Plague, without loſs of time, and in the moſt proper ways, let them Purge, Cleanſe and Remove it, and then uſe means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to keep it out, and hinder its coming in: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards let them meet and joyn Heads together, and be a mutual Help, and take ſuch wholſom and vigorous Reſolutions, as may, by the Bleſſing of God, root out and prevent the growing of thoſe dangerous Weeds: Let every one, not only within his Precincts, labour againſt the Diſtemper, but alſo altogether ſtrive to drive it out of the Land: Let them uſe their Authority, as far as it reacheth, in Eccleſiaſtical things; and wherein it falls ſhort, they may, for help, apply to the Civil Power, and thoſe amongſt them whom God hath endued with ſufficient Parts and Learning: Let them, in God's Name, make uſe of thoſe Weapons to fight againſt and batter down Error and Hereſie; to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and diſcountenance it in the Fautors and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors thereof: And ſpeedily they muſt go about it, for fear of coming too late; for 'tis too true, and too publick, how the Poiſon is gotten, not only here and there, up and down, but alſo into our very Vitals, I mean into the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities:</hi> Let them but be Real and Upright for God and our Saviour's Intereſt, and truſt God for a Succeſs: But at one time or other<note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 48.10.</note> 
               <hi>the Curſe of God will light upon thoſe that do his Work deceitfully,</hi> or negligently. Wherefore mind ye Chriſt, if ye will have him to mind you; be concerned for him and his Glory, if you deſire him to be concerned for you.</p>
            <p>My next Addreſs is, to the Magiſtrate and Secular Power, whither Supreme or Subordinate, Legiſlative or

               <hi>Sword</hi> in their Hand, which <hi>they bear not in vain, for he is the Miniſter of God, a Revenger to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute Wrath upon him that doth Evil;</hi> not only to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their own Authority, but alſo and chiefly that of God, for all Authority is originatively in him, and but derivatively in them; for in his Name, and by Vertue of his Commiſſion, is all Juriſdiction, and all Judgment to be executed: They are the Keepers of both Tables, to puniſh not only the Tranſgreſſors of the ſecond, but alſo thoſe of the firſt; not only Adulterers, Thieves and Murtherers, but alſo Profane, Impious Idolaters and Blaſphemers: I do not ſay preſently to Hang, Draw and Quarter, but let the Guilty be diſcountenanced, and the Obſtinate and Contumacious puniſhed: Herein let Chriſtian Prudence be their Guide, and the Law of the Land, not without God's, be the Rule, whereby they will unneſt our Atheiſtical, Impious and Prophane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who do ſhelter themſelves under <hi>Socinianiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſure the Devil and all the Powers of Hell, can raiſe no Opinions more Damnable and Blaſphemous, no more Deſtructive to the very Foundation of Faith and Salvation, than to bring in amongſt a Chriſtian Society, that which ſpares not, but ſtrikes at Divinity it ſelf, which offers to pull out of God's Boſom his only begotten Son; who robs that very Son of God, of his Nature, and of that Glory which he had with the Father from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and undertakes to Annihilate that Holy and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41738:20"/>Bleſſed Spirit of God: This, indeed, is to grieve him that comforteth us in all our Griefs, and at once to overthrow the whole Myſtery of our Redemption; for if Chriſt be not God, he hath not ſatisfied the Juſtice of God, nor appeaſed his Wrath: And thus our Faith is vain, and we are ſtill in our Sins; for it was impoſſible for any Man, meerly ſuch, to perform that great Work, and overcome all our Enemies: I ſay, though God had ſtrengthned him never ſo much, for no Man could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a greater Power than Humane Nature is capable of; and God could not of a Man make a God, becauſe it implies a Contradiction: Humanity being paſſible, was a fit ſubject to ſuffer Pains due for Sin and the Curſe of the Law; but an Infinite Power was neceſſary to get the Victory over thoſe Torments, and over Death. I ſay not only that Humane Nature alone could not perform this; but I add, That Angelical Nature, more noble and perfect, would have ſunk under the Weight and Burthen of it.</p>
            <p>Theſe Errors we muſt look upon as Helliſh and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Monſters, as indeed they are, but withall the Impudence and Shameleſneſs of thoſe that are therewith infected, is a great Aggravation, they Glory in their Shame, for with a bare and brazen Face, they own and publiſh their Opinions, which I could obſerve to my Grief and Amazement: No Modeſty in their Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, no ſign of Piety in their Diſcourſe, no Check of Conſcience; they ſpeak openly, write publickly, and boldly diſperſe their Erroneous Books; and no Curb, no Reſtraint put upon them; they Poiſon the Souls, and no body ſaith to them, What doeſt thou? We have the <hi>Ny—s,</hi> the <hi>Fer—ns,</hi> the <hi>Fr—ks,</hi> &amp;c. known for what they be; we have here, as I am informed, one <hi>Crel—us</hi> Nephew to that Infamous <hi>Socinian</hi> beyond Sea; we have here ſome Fr—ch Wretches, who, before they came over, durſt not own their Opinions, for fear
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41738:21"/>of Fire and Faggot, yet here vent them with Liberty, who if ever they went back, would no doubt draw in their Horns; nay, ſome of them take upon them to Travel abroad in the Capacity of Governours to young Noblemen and Gentlemen, though in a high degree in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with that Plague; yet theſe things are not taken notice of, though of ſuch a Nature as deſerves ſtrictly to be look'd and narrowly inquired into: And God knows what Judgments this is like to bring upon the Nation, as if before we had not Sins enough to anſwer for, but there muſt be this new Addition: However, we have ſome Law againſt Blaſphemy and <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> which makes great Noiſe, and ſpreads too much; God knows whoſe Fault it is, with the Royal Prophet we muſt ſay,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.126.</note> 
               <hi>It is time for thee, Lord, to work, for they have made void thy Law.</hi>

            <p>We want no Preſidents nor Examples out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, to ſhew how 'tis the Magiſtrates Duty to puniſh ſuch Enormities, for as they have the Sword to defend the Innocent, ſo 'tis to puniſh Malefactors, of which there can be no greater than Blaſphemers: As of the two kinds of Treaſons, that which is againſt the Prince's Perſon is in a higher degree and greater than that againſt his Government; ſo the Blaſphemy againſt God's Works and Providence, may be called leſs than that which is immediately againſt his Nature and Perſons: God requireth of <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and ſo they in Conſcience are bound to provide, that Subjects be rightly inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in his True Religion, and conſequently to have every thing removed and puniſhed that is contrary thereunto: This courſe was taken by the good Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> as <hi>Aſa, Jehoſhaphat, Hezechiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah;</hi> ſo ſince Chriſt's Coming good Chriſtian Emperors did ſo; hence to ſuppreſs Hereticks, the Councils of <hi>Nice, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, Epheſus, Calcedon,</hi> were ſummoned by the Emperors <hi>Conſtantine, Theodoſius, Martian,</hi> &amp;c. as to the

            <p>Laſtly, I come and addreſs to all and every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Subject, of whatſoever Rank and Quality, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Noble or Ignoble, High or Low, Rich or Poor, Young or Old, and earneſtly deſire them, as they are tender of the Glory of God, of their own Salvation, and of the Welfare and Proſperity of their Religion and Country, not to ſuffer themſelves to be miſlead and ſeduced by thoſe Ravenous Wolves, who do not come in Sheeps-cloathings, for they deal above-board, but like Roaring Lyons; with ſuch keep no company, and as much as poſſibly you can, avoid all Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 5.11.</note>

               <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle in another place, <hi>I beſeech you Brethren, mark them which cauſe Diviſions and Offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye have received, and avoid them:</hi> This is both Warning and Command, and Beſeeching againſt the Enemies of the True Doctrine he taught, the reaſon he gives in the next Verſe, <hi>For they that are ſuch, ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own Belly, and by good Words and fair Speeches deceive the Hearts of the Simple:</hi> Let the Simple beware of ſuch Deceivers. This Advice in ſuch caſes he gives the Simple, as being moſt of all in danger of being ſeduced; but to the Learned and Clergy in the Perſon of <hi>Titus,</hi> he ſaith that which I wiſh them to mind,<note n="*" place="margin">Tit. 3.10, 11.</note>

            <p>Here I cannot forbear, with all due Reſpect, in God's Name, to declare to Kings, Parliaments, and to any that have a Hand in the Civil or Eccleſiaſtical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that in caſe they every one in their Station, and to the utmoſt of their Power, do not go about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain and ſuppreſs that Damnable and Antichriſtian Poiſon, they thereby become acceſſary to the Blaſphemy; it is their Duty, and in their Power, to oppoſe it; which to neglect, is to encourage it; for Impunity is an Encouragement to Crimes; and they muſt know, God at one time or other will require it at their hands, and theſe few Lines I have written, ſhall riſe up in Judgment againſt them: Let them remember and apply <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s words to <hi>Eſther,</hi>

               <hi>If thou altogether holdeſt thy Peace at this time, then ſhall Deliverance ariſe from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place; but thou and thy Father's Houſe ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to thoſe whom I am Addreſſing to, I ſay to them, Miſtruſt the Deceitfulneſs of Sin, the Crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Devil, and the Weakneſs and Corruption of your own Hearts: As you are to avoid their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, ſo have nothing to do with their Books; this I ſpeak chiefly to the Ignorant and Unlearned, who muſt never read them, but in the Works of ſound Divines that refute them; but be very frequent in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word of God, which can afford both Offenſive and Defenſive Weapons againſt ſuch Enemies; therein you may find ſtrong and full Proofs, with Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Divinity of our Bleſſed Saviour, of the Holy Ghoſt, and of every other high and neceſſary Point of our Faith, for therein God hath not left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without a Witneſs againſt all Oppoſers and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers whatſoever.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:41738:22"/>
            <p>This againſt ſuch Deceivers and Antichriſts as St. <hi>John</hi> calls them in his ſecond Epiſtle, I ſhall now conclude with what the ſame Apoſtle ſaith in the ſame place, <hi>If there come any unto you, and bring not this Doctrine,</hi>
